### Laboratory Experiment No. 4
 
### Objective  
To interface & toggle a 8-bit LED panel connected to the AT89S52 microcontroller (Flashing LEDs)
 
### Tools used  
- Software: 
  - MCU 8051 IDE 

### Experiment Outcome
- To learn about LED panels 
- To use Assembly instructions to toggle individual LEDs of the panel
- To develop a logic to flash the LEDs in a random/pre-configured sequenc
- To generate delay by means of the Rx registers
- To use loops & jumps to perform the delay operations

### Instructions

1. Read about Port registers of 8051 from 8051-Kenneth Ayala book
2. Use the Atmel 8051 Instruction sheet document to learn about the arithmetic instructions
